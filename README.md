The Swift Path
==============

While on retreat Lama Phurbu Tashi Rinpoche received many teachings on mahamudra
from Bokar Rinpoche. These teachings were extensively supported by quotes, mostly
from the great Kagyu Masters. Lama kept a notebook of these quotes for his own
instruction and inspiration. When I asked Lama for instruction in the Tibetan
language, he asked me to translate this notebook as an exercise. This is a
transcription of the notebook, together with my translation. The quality of the
translation is uneven and if you have suggestions for improving it, just ask
on github.

TThe quotes are formatted as html and are structured as a web
site with minimal formatting. The page names match the numbering of the pages in
the original notebook. The letter a indicates the first quote starting on that
page, b indicates the second, and so on.

Each page contains the quote in Tibetan Unicode characters, a transcription
using the Wylie transliteration, and a tentative translation. The line breaks in
the Tibetan and Wylie match those in the notebook, to facilitate making
corrections. Formatting is kept to the minimum required to make the quote
readable. The intent is to allow generation of different formats using software.

I have written a Perl script, scripts/combine.pl that allows you to generate a
single html, markdown, or plain text file from the files. Type
'scripts/combine.pl --help' to see how to use the script.

The quotes are all in the public domain and the translation is freely licensed.
License terms are in the LICENSE file. The directory contains the Jolmohari
Tibetan font for those who do not have Tibetan fonts installed on their
computer. It was created by Chris Fynn and is also freely licensed.
