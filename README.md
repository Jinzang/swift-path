The Swift Path
==============

This repository contains a partial transcription and translation of a collection of quotes compiled by Lama Phurbu Tashi while doing the traditional three year retreat in India. The quotes are formatted as html and are structured as a web site with minimal formatting. The page names match the numbering of the pages in the original notebook. The letter a indicates the first quote starting on that page, b indicates the second, and so on. 

Each page contains the quote in Tibetan Unicode characters, a transcription using  the Wylie transliteration, and a tentative translation. The line breaks in the Tibetan and Wylie match those in the notebook, to facilitate making corrections. Formatting is kept to the minimum required to make the quote readable. The intent is to allow generation of different formats using software. This software is yet to be written. 

The quotes are all in the public domain and the translation is freely licensed. The directory contains the Jolmohari Tibetan font for those who do not have Tibetan fonts installed on their computer. It was created by Chris Fynn and is also freely licensed.
